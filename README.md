# macOS Dotfiles Setup ‚Äì Overview & Guide

This repository contains my macOS dotfiles and setup scripts for a new machine. It automates the installation of development tools, configures the shell and applications, and applies custom settings (DNS, Touch ID for sudo, etc.) for a consistent environment.

## üöÄ Setting Up a New Mac

1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. **Clone this Repository**  
- Replace placeholder URL with your repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stefmf/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
```

3. **Run the Bootstrap Script**  
  ```bash
  ./.bootstrap/macos/bootstrap_macos.zsh
  ```
  The script will install tools, symlink configs, configure Touch ID for `sudo`, set up DNS/MagicDNS, enable services, and apply your Dock layout.

  You'll first be prompted to choose whether the script should use automated
  `sudo` via `SUDO_ASKPASS` or request your password manually for each
  privileged command. On managed Macs where non-interactive `sudo` is blocked,
  answer **n** to use interactive prompts.

### Authenticate with GitHub

Once `gh` is installed, you‚Äôll be prompted to log in:

```bash
gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol ssh
```

The bootstrap will then attempt to pull your name and email from your GitHub profile and configure:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

If your email is private or the fetch fails, you may need to set them manually.

4. **Restart Terminal**  
   Open a new window or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```
   If you installed new fonts (e.g., JetBrains Mono Nerd Font), update your Terminal/iTerm2 profile to use them.

## üîê Touch ID for `sudo`

- Uses `/etc/pam.d/sudo_local` (survives OS updates).

Run any `sudo` command and tap your sensor instead of typing a password.  
**Troubleshoot:** Ensure `/etc/pam.d/sudo_local` contains the `pam_tid.so` line and you‚Äôve authenticated once since reboot.

---

## üåê DNS & MagicDNS

We use Tailscale‚Äôs MagicDNS with a local `dnsmasq` resolver:

- System DNS is set to **127.0.0.1** for all interfaces.
- `dnsmasq` forwards:
  - `*.ts.net` queries to **100.100.100.100** (Tailscale MagicDNS).
  - Other queries to **8.8.8.8** (or your preferred upstream).

Verify with:
```bash
scutil --dns | grep nameserver
sudo lsof -i :53
```

To revert:
```bash
sudo networksetup -setdnsservers "Wi-Fi" Empty
sudo networksetup -setdnsservers "Ethernet" Empty
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Services & Tools

- **Tailscale VPN**: Runs as a system daemon (`tailscaled`). Authenticate once with `tailscale up`.
- **dnsmasq**: Runs on boot via Brew services. Config at `~/.config/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.conf`.  
  Restart with:
  ```bash
  sudo brew services restart dnsmasq
  ```

The `Brewfile` installs CLI tools, shells, productivity apps, Docker/K8s tools, fonts, and casks (iTerm2, VSCode, Chrome, etc.).

---

## üîß Post-Install Tips

- **Tailscale Login**:  
  ```bash
  tailscale up
  ```
- **Check Services**:  
  ```bash
  brew services list   # dnsmasq
  tailscale status     # Tailscale
  ```
- **Troubleshoot DNS**:  
  1. Confirm `dnsmasq` is listening on port 53.  
  2. Check `127.0.0.1` in `scutil --dns`.  
  3. Ensure Tailscale is connected for `*.ts.net` resolution.  
  4. Review logs: `/opt/homebrew/var/log/dnsmasq.log`.

- **Updating Dotfiles**:  
  Pull updates and re-run:
  ```bash
  ~/.dotfiles/install
  ```
  or the bootstrap script.

Enjoy your fully automated, Touch-ID-enabled, MagicDNS-powered macOS development setup!
